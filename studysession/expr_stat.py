#Expressions
1 + 8 * 4 # Has a value of 33
x = 17 # not an expression
print (x == 17) # Has a value True
x = 28 # not an expression
print ( x== 17) # Has a value False
33 # Has a value of 33

# statements 
print ("Hello World") # This is a funtion call
x = 17 #This is a variable assignent 

print (x == 17) # PRINT_3
