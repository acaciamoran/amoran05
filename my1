Welcome aboard the Lunar Module Flight Simulator

   To begin you must specify the LM's initial altitude
   and fuel level.  To simulate the actual LM use
   values of 1300 meters and 500 liters, respectively.

   Good luck and may the force be with you!

Enter the initial altitude of the LM (in meters): Enter the initial amount of fuel on board the LM (in liters):

Enter fuel rate (0-9, 0=freefall, 5=constant velocity, 9=max thrust): Elapsed Time:    3 s
        Fuel:   50 l
        Rate:    0 l/s
    Altitude:    2.71 m
    Velocity:   -4.86 m/s

Enter fuel rate (0-9, 0=freefall, 5=constant velocity, 9=max thrust): 
LM state at landing/impact
Elapsed Time:    4 s
